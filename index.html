    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I examine how occupational structures and policy environments shape gendered and racial/ethnic inequalities in work, family, and health.</p>
    <p>My Dissertation, <em>Occupational Segregation and Individual Outcomes in Work, Health, and Family</em>, uses quantitative longitudinal data from various administrative sources to investigate the effect of occupational structure on the individual outcomes. Across three empirical chapters, I ask how occupational gender and racial/ethnic compositions influence individual employment status, health changes, and intergenerational mobility. </p> 
    <p>My current projects focus on paid family leave, occupational segregation, and health disparities.</p>
    <p>I grew up mostly in Seoul, South Korea, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Outside of my acadmic life, I can often be found knitting or enjoying the company of my cat, Leo.</p>
