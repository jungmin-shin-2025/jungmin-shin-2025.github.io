             <p>Despite relative progress, it is an overt fact that women still take on the heavier burden of unpaid work in the household compared to men in the United States. Our study expands the horizons of previous studies by looking at women specifically and analyzes how women’s performance of unpaid labor differentiates based on various contexts such as generational status, household composition, race, and ethnicity. Using the pooled cross-sectional data from the 2011-2021 American Time Use Survey (ATUS), we test hypotheses derived from an absolute resources perspective and a structural perspective to examine migrant generational differences among married, cohabiting, and single women as well as investigate the intra-group differences of racial and ethnic groups. From our descriptive analysis and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses, we find support for the structural perspective for housework, as the generational differences remain even after controlling for socioeconomic factors, but only for first-generation married women. However, socioeconomic factors account for the differences between cohabiting or single first-generation women, which is supported by the absolute resources perspective. Our intra-group analysis by racial and ethnic groups yielded similar findings but found that Hispanic and Asian first-generation women take on a larger proportion of housework, relative to later-generation women.</p>

             <p><strong>Objectives</strong> Guided by the theories of immigrant health and incorporation, this research explores the patterns of health disparities by immigrant generation and race/ethnicity at older ages. Specifically, we compare the health status of first (foreign-born), second (U.S.-born with two foreign-born parents), 2.5 (U.S.-born with one foreign-born parent), and third-plus (U.S.-born with two U.S.-born parents) generation older immigrants in the USA by broad racial/ethnic categories.</p>
              <p><strong>Methods</strong> We use data from the 2010–2021 Current Population Survey and employ logistic regressions to model the probability of having functional limitations and poor/fair self-rated health (SRH) among non-institutionalized adults aged 50 and over in the USA (N = 675,877).</p>
              <p><strong>Results</strong> All first-generation immigrants, regardless of race and ethnicity, and second-generation non-Hispanic White and Mexican older immigrants have a lower probability of having a functional limitation compared to their third-plus-generation counterparts of the same race/ethnicity. An immigrant health advantage is also present among 2.5-generation non-Hispanic White immigrants, but all racial and ethnic minority 2.5-generation older immigrants have similar or worse functional health than their third-plus-generation coethnic counterparts. The SRH disparities by immigrant generation vary significantly by race/ethnicity.</p> 
              <p><strong>Discussion</strong> The immigrant health advantage among second-generation older immigrants provides evidence that a health advantage could be transmitted intergenerationally and maintained over the life course. The racial/ethnic differences suggest that health-promoting influences of immigrant parents could be constrained by structural forces, racism, and discrimination.</p>

          “Devaluation or Differential Values? The Effect of Occupational Segregation on Wages and Work Values” — with Jonathan Dirlam — <strong>Under Review for <em>Work, Employment and Society</em></strong>.
          <details class="abstract-toggle">
              <summary>Abstract</summary>
             <p>Despite initial decreases in occupational segregation by gender, progress has slowed in recent decades in the USA. This article investigates this persistence by testing compensating differential theory and devaluation theory. Using longitudinal fixed-effects models and data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Occupation Information Network (O*NET) from 2011 to 2019, the study evaluates how changes in the proportion of women in occupations affect wages and work values. Findings support devaluation theory, as occupational wages decline once women reach a statistical majority in an occupation. Results do not provide strong evidence for compensating differential values theory, which posits that men and women value different work benefits. Among six work values, only Relationships shows a negative linear association, with a marginally significant quadratic pattern. By examining both occupational wage and work values, this study sheds light on mechanisms that continue to perpetuate occupational gender segregation.</p>

          “The Impact of Structural Sexism and the #MeToo Movement on Sexual Harassment” — with Heeyoung Lee and Jonathan Dirlam — <strong>Under Review for <em>The Sociological Quarterly</em></strong>.

             <p>While prior literature has suggested several perspectives to explain why sexual harassment occurs in the workplace, much of the research focuses on individual factors to explain this behavior. This study examines the effect of structural factors on the occurrence of sexual harassment at work. Using longitudinal fixed effects models and state level data from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), this study evaluates the effect of state level structural sexism on sexual harassment charge rates from 2005-2021. We also assess how the #MeToo movement has influenced sexual harassment charges for both male and female victims. Findings suggest that female victims who live in states with higher economic structural sexism are more likely to report sexual harassment charges. Furthermore, the effect of economic structural sexism is exacerbated after the #MeToo movement. The impact of non-economic structural sexism was not statistically significant. The pattern for the male victims is less consistent and appears to not be influenced by structural sexism. By examining both economic and non-economic structural sexism, this study goes beyond the individual level analysis on sexual harassment and expands the scope of understanding sexual harassment at work.</p>
