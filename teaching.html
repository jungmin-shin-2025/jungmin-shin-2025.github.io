      <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
      
      <p>
        My teaching focuses on helping students <strong>actively engage</strong> with sociological ideas and
        <strong>apply them to real-world questions</strong> about inequality, work, and social change. I design
        courses that balance <strong>clear structure</strong> with <strong>intellectual challenge</strong>,
        encouraging students to participate, collaborate, and <strong>defend their reasoning using evidence</strong>.
        Across course levels and formats, I emphasize <strong>consistent engagement</strong>,
        <strong>transparent expectations</strong>, and <strong>applied learning activities</strong> that connect
        sociological concepts to students’ everyday experiences. My goal is to help students
        <strong>build confidence in their analytical abilities</strong> while developing skills that extend beyond
        the classroom.

      <h2>Pedagogical Strengths</h2>
      <div class="strengths">
      <ul class="clean">
  <li>
    <strong>Active participation and collaborative learning.</strong><br>
    I design courses around structured group activities that require students to discuss concepts, articulate their reasoning, and work toward shared conclusions. These collaborative exercises encourage active participation and help students learn from one another, particularly in courses that involve complex or unfamiliar material.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Engaging and inclusive classroom environments.</strong><br>
    I foster classrooms where students feel comfortable contributing ideas, asking questions, and taking intellectual risks. Course discussions emphasize respectful dialogue and evidence-based reasoning, creating an environment in which diverse perspectives are valued.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Applied learning and real-world engagement.</strong><br>
    Assignments are designed to connect sociological theories and methods to students’ lived experiences, helping students see how abstract concepts operate in everyday social contexts.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Structured support for challenging material.</strong><br>
    In research methods and statistics courses, I break complex concepts into manageable components, reinforce learning through frequent low-stakes assignments, and align lectures, homework, and assessments closely.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Consistency across teaching modalities.</strong><br>
    Whether teaching in-person or online, I use clear organization, predictable pacing, and transparent expectations to support sustained student engagement and learning.
  </li>
</ul>
