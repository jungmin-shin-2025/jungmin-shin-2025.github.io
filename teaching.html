    <h1>Teaching</h1>

    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      My teaching focuses on helping students <strong>actively engage</strong> with sociological ideas and
      <strong>apply them to real-world questions</strong> about inequality, work, and social change.
      I design courses that balance <strong>clear structure</strong> with
      <strong>intellectual challenge</strong>, encouraging students to participate, collaborate, and
      <strong>defend their reasoning using evidence</strong>.
      Across course levels and formats, I emphasize <strong>consistent engagement</strong>,
      <strong>transparent expectations</strong>, and <strong>applied learning activities</strong> that
      connect sociological concepts to students’ everyday experiences.
      My goal is to help students <strong>build confidence in their analytical abilities</strong>
      while developing skills that extend beyond the classroom.
    </p>

    <h2>Pedagogical Strengths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Active participation and collaborative learning.</strong>
        I structure courses around group activities that require students to discuss concepts,
        work toward shared conclusions, and learn from one another.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Engaging and inclusive classroom environments.</strong>
        I foster classrooms where students feel comfortable contributing ideas,
        asking questions, and taking intellectual risks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Applied learning and real-world engagement.</strong>
        Assignments connect sociological theories and methods to students’ lived experiences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Structured support for challenging material.</strong>
        In methods and statistics courses, I break complex material into manageable components
        and align lectures, homework, and assessments closely.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Consistency across teaching modalities.</strong>
        Whether teaching in-person or online, I use clear organization and predictable pacing.
