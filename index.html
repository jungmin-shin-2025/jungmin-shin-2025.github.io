        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My broad research focuses on how work and famiy structures affect inequalities in health and labor market outcomes at the intersection of gender and race/ethnicity, at the individual, occupational, and population levels. Much of the work bridges organizational sociology, sociology of families, and public health. I have a deep interest in advancing the use of quantitative data at various levels to understand social life. </p>
        <p>My Dissertation, <em>Occupational Segregation and Individual Outcomes in Work, Health, and Family</em>, uses quantitative longitudinal data from various administrative sources to investigate the effect of occupational structure on the individual outcomes. Across three empirical chapters, I ask how occupational gender and racial/ethnic compositions influence individual employment status, health changes, and intergenerational mobility. </p> 
        <p>My other research has also focused on how occupational structures and policy environments shape gendered and racial/ethnic inequalities in work, family, and health. In one study, published in <em>The Journals of Gerontology:Series B</em>, my coauthor and I examine how the health disparities are persistent at older ages, especially for the immigrant families. In another study, published in <em>Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies</em>, my colleague and I investigate the racial/ehtnic inequalities in unpaid labor, focusing on the immigrant women's experiences. My current projects focus on paid family leave, occupational segregation, and health disparities.</p>
        <p>I grew up mostly in Seoul, South Korea, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Outside of my acadmic life, I can often be found knitting or enjoying the company of my cat, Leo.</p>
